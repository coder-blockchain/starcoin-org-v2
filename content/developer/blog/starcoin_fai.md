Recently, Starcoin ecosystem has had comprehensive upgrade. After Oracle, NFT and other leading-edge applications have joined Starcoin ecosystem, a batch of  applications in the DeFi field such as Swap, Stablecoin, and Bridge has emerged.

The FAI track has been deployed on Starcoin's Barnard network and will be launched on the main network soon. When FAI is about to launch, read FAI operation guide, and let's start together. 

## Select the Correct Network

Set up StarMask's network first. If it is the main network, choose the Starcoin main network. In this article, we will use the Barnard test network, so set the StarMask network to the Barnard network.

## Ensure StarMask Has Enough STC

StarMask must have enough STC to perform subsequent operations FAI. Run test on the Barnard network, so you need to apply for the STC required for the test through the Starcoin faucet. In the case of the main network, users are required to top up their wallet accounts by themselves. 

1. ##### Faucet

   Find Barnard's Faucet on Starcoin official website

3. ##### Apply for Test STC

   Fill in the account address in step 2 to the Starcoin faucet opened in step 1 to apply for STC on the Barnard testnet.

   It should be noted here that, in order to prevent malicious applications, the faucet website needs to bind a Twitter account to apply.

## Starcoin and FAI

Starcoin has several expectable stablecoin projects, and FAI is one of the high-quality projects. This article is the guide of FAI. For more information about FAI's model, please pay attention to FAI's official website.
